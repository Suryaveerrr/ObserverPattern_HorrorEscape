# ObserverPattern_HorrorEscape

This is a short Unity-based horror game developed as a learning project to implement and understand the Observer Pattern using C# delegates, events, and Actions. The game is designed with a minimal scope and focuses on modular, event-driven architecture rather than gameplay complexity.

---

## Overview

The game begins in a dark room where the player must find three keys to escape. During the exploration, multiple horror events are triggered through an event-based system. These include changes in lighting, sound effects, and other atmospheric elements designed to simulate a horror environment.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of:

- The Observer Pattern in a Unity environment  
- C# delegates and events  
- Actions and Funcs for loosely coupled systems  
- Unityâ€™s trigger system and prefab instantiation  
- Basic modular architecture for scene interaction

---

## Features

- Main menu with basic UI and scene loading  
- In-game event system using custom event broadcasters and listeners  
- Three-key collection system required to unlock progression  
- Multiple scripted horror events (e.g., lights off, ambient sounds, jump scare triggers)  
- Modular scripts for interaction and environment control  

---

## Technologies Used

- Unity 2021.3.21f1 LTS  
- C# (Delegates, Events, Actions, Funcs)  
- Unity UI System  
- Unity Collider-based interactions  
- Prefab-based asset structure  

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the Observer Pattern in a real-world context  
- Gain hands-on experience with C# delegates, events, and Actions  
- Build a modular and scalable Unity architecture  
- Learn scene transition and state tracking in Unity
